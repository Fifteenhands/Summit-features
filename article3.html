        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            In radiation therapy, heart motion characterization can provide useful information for analyzing the risk of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity and establishing motion management strategies for optimized treatment delivery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiation therapy systems provide on-board cine images and allow systematic and quantitative investigations of heart motion during radiation treatment (Chen, Reyhan, Yue, Metaxas, Haffty, Goyal, 2015, Huang, Petibon, Ouyang, Reese, Ahlman, Bluemke, El Fakhri, 2015, Weygand, Fuller, Ibbott, Mohamed, Ding, Yang, Hwang, Wang, 2016). Manual delineation of heart contours is time-consuming and therefore not practically feasible for clinical workflows. There is a great need for automatic or semi-automatic motion tracking methods. However, automatic heart motion tracking is a very challenging task due to the complex spatial relationship between the heart and its neighboring structures, dynamic heart shape changes during involuntary motion, and the low-contrast/resolution of cine MRI images.

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>
            Automatic or semi-automatic heart motion tracking methods can be categorized as image-based (Lu, Radau, Connelly, Dick, Wright, 2009, Huang, Liu, Lee, Venkatesh, Teo, Au, Nowinski, 2009), classification-based (Stalidis, Maglaveras, Efstratiadis, Dimitriadis, Pappas, 2002, Kedenburg, Cocosco, Köthe, Niessen, Vonken, Viergever, 2006), and deformable model-based methods (Petitjean, Dacher, 2011, Xu, Prince, 1998, Battani, Corsi, Sarti, Lamberti, Piva, Fattori, 2003, Liu, Zhang, Wu, Li, Shang, 2013, Brieva, Moya-Albor, Escalante-Ramírez, 2015, Feng, Li, Zhao, Davatzikos, Litt, 2013, Liu, Captur, Moon, Guo, Yang, Zhang, Li, 2016). Deformable model-based methods, including snakes (Kass et al., 1988), level-set evolution (Osher and Sethian, 1988), and their variants (Xu, Prince, 1998, Battani, Corsi, Sarti, Lamberti, Piva, Fattori, 2003, Liu, Zhang, Wu, Li, Shang, 2013, Brieva, Moya-Albor, Escalante-Ramírez, 2015, Feng, Li, Zhao, Davatzikos, Litt, 2013, Liu, Captur, Moon, Guo, Yang, Zhang, Li, 2016), have been widely applied for heart or ventricle segmentation on cardiac gated images. Level set-based methods evolve an initially defined contour or shape to achieve the boundaries of desired objects through the minimization of pre-defined energy functions. However, conventional level set methods (Chan, Vese, 2001, Li, Kao, Gore, Ding, 2008) lack the ability to handle curve irregularities during the evolution and might lose the evolution stability. The distance regularized level-set evolution (DRLSE) method (Li et al., 2010) includes an additional regularization term in the energy function to avoid shape irregularities and instability during the level set evolution process while eliminating the need for level set re-initialization. Liu and coauthors extended the DRLSE method to a two-level-set formulation specifically for segmenting endocardium and epicardium simultaneously by utilizing the spatial relationship between them (Liu et al., 2016). However, these methods only consider the intensity information in the images for the motion tracking and is prone to becoming trapped in local minima, resulting in the “boundary leaking” problem.

            To improve segmentation accuracy, the level set energy function can include a penalty that encodes a priori information about the desired shapes, which is established by use of a set of representative training images with delineated shape contours. For example, two segmentation methods Sun et al. (2005) and Pham et al. (2014) have been proposed that utilized a statistical shape model that was trained with a set of representative left ventricle shapes observed in cardiac MRI images. However, most of the reported shape priors were generated based on linear combinations of static training shapes only, and are not well-suited for dynamic heart motion tracking.

        <h2>Deep Learning Methods</h2>
        <p>
            Deep learning methods recently gained significant attention due to their excellent performance on robustly extracting features from complex images. Deep learning methods have been applied to solve various computer vision problems such as image classification (Guo, Liu, Oerlemans, Lao, Wu, Lew, 2016, Gidaris, Komodakis, 2015, Zhang, Sohn, Villegas, Pan, Lee, 2015), object detection (Liang et al., 2015), image retrieval (Sun, Zhou, Li, Tian, 2014, Babenko, Slesarev, Chigorin, Lempitsky, 2014), and semantic segmentation (Long et al., 2015). Recently, deep learning methods have also been applied in medical image segmentation. Two automatic MRI brain image segmentation methods Pereira et al. (2016) and Moeskops et al. (2016) have been proposed by using convolutional neural networks (CNN). In their methods, the CNN is used to learn a high-level representation and abstraction of each image patch of the brain MR images. A CNN-based method normally takes intensity information within regions-of-interest as input while neglecting the shape information carried by the interesting object boundary. Incorporating organ shape information into the segmentation process can potentially improve the accuracy of segmenting challenging anatomical organs like the heart.

            Recently, there has been significant progress in applying generative models for medical image analysis (van Tulder, de Bruijne, 2016, Zhang, Zhang, Li, Metaxas, 2014, Agn, Law, af Rosenschöld, Van Leemput, 2016). For example, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) (Hinton, 2010) has been widely used for classification, feature learning, filtering, and modeling (Larochelle, Bengio, 2008, Su, Thomas, Cheung, 2016, Melchior, Wang, Wiskott, 2017). The RBM is a powerful generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs. The RBM has gained increasing attention in organ shape modeling for medical image segmentation applications (Zhang, Zhang, Li, Metaxas, 2014, Agn, Law, af Rosenschöld, Van Leemput, 2016). A shape model based on a two-layer Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GB-RBM) has been proposed (Zhang et al., 2014) to model lung shapes for lung segmentation. Furthermore, a convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (cRBM) was employed to form the tumor shape prior (Agn et al., 2016) due to its capability of modeling higher-order interactions between voxels through local connections to hidden units. Then, a Gaussian mixture model-based method was proposed for brain tumor segmentation by modeling the relationships between tumor intensities and using cRBM-driven shape information. Although the RBM can impose local constraints such as smoothness and continuity, traditional RBMs lack the ability to capture global properties of complicated shapes. By using structured inference on a Deep Belief Network (DBN) (Hinton et al., 2006), the global shape priors of left ventricle endocardium and epicardium (Ngo et al., 2017) can be learned and used for segmentation purposes. However, as a directed model, the DBN lacks the ability to receive feedback from a higher layer to a lower layer and might generate a sub-optimal shape model.
        </p>

            Another deep generative model, the deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009), has been proposed and yields the ability to build undirected probabilistic shape models. The DBM can build a strong probabilistic shape model of objects that meets the requirements of both realism and generalization by capturing more global and local constraints of object shapes than RBM and DBN. Realism means that samples from the model should look realistic. Generalization means that the model should yield the ability to generate realistic samples even if it is trained with a relatively small-sized training dataset. The DBM has been approved to be able to characterize various object shapes and its performance on realism and generalization was validated (Eslami, Nicolas, John, 2012, Eslami, Heess, Williams, Winn, 2014). To date, the DBM has been mainly applied to model binary object shapes for computer vision applications (Eslami, Williams, 2012, Chen, Yu, Hu, Zeng, 2013), and has not yet found widespread application in the medical imaging field, especially for organ segmentation in medical applications.

            The heart undergoes continuous cardiac and respiratory motion. Therefore, it is more challenging to build a robust shape model for the heart in comparison with other static structures. Inspired by the strong shape representation ability of the DBM (Eslami et al., 2014), we propose to obtain shape constraints with a DBM and use the shape constraints for heart motion tracking on cine MR images. A three-layered DBM was employed to construct a reliable heart shape model that can effectively characterize both the global and local heart shape variations. The shape model was embedded into a distance regularized level set-based segmentation method for heart shape tracking by effectively combining the stability of DRLSE method with the strong generating ability of DBM-trained shape model. The tracking accuracy was measured by comparing the results to the average of two manual delineations in thirty-eight cine MRI datasets from nineteen volunteer cases.
