            <div class="caption">In medical procedures such as radiation therapy or surgical interventions, precise targeting of affected areas is paramount. Motion tracking enables real-time adjustments to compensate for patient movement, ensuring that therapeutic doses are accurately delivered to the intended location. This precision minimizes collateral damage to healthy tissues and maximizes therapeutic efficacy, thereby improving patient outcomes.</div>

            <div class="caption"> Motion tracking provides detailed insights into physiological processes and organ functions that involve motion, such as cardiac activity, respiratory dynamics, and joint movements. By analyzing motion patterns, healthcare professionals can detect abnormalities, monitor disease progression, and tailor treatment strategies accordingly. This capability enhances diagnostic accuracy and enables early intervention in conditions that manifest through abnormal motion patterns.</div>

            <div class="caption"> In surgical procedures and rehabilitation therapies, understanding and quantifying motion dynamics are essential for planning and evaluating outcomes. Motion tracking technologies facilitate the development of minimally invasive surgical techniques by providing precise navigation within the body and enabling targeted tissue manipulation. Similarly, in rehabilitation, tracking patient movements allows therapists to customize exercises and monitor progress, promoting effective recovery and functional restoration.</div>
